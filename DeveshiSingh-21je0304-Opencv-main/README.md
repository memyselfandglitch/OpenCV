What I have done:
Finding contours and detecting squares separate from quadrilateral and other figrues
Aligned the aruco markers and resized them to be oreinted on the squares

I have not been able to finally put the marker on the image with shapes as I could not use the wrap function succesfully to align the corners of the markers to the corners of the squares

**Update**
I have used functions to perform every task which includes:
finding the corners of aruco markers and ids,
finding slope, length and corners of squares
finding colors of squares
augmenting the markers with the square
